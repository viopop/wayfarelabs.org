    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Wayfare Labs, a California non-profit corporation, runs a one-year startup incubator program for founders seeking to birth organizations that intentionally pursue the worldâ€™s best future. These organizations may be formed as for-profit, non-profit, or hybrid entities. Wayfare Labs is available to act as fiscal sponsor for organizations forming as non-profits prior to their receipt of 501(c)3 status, accelerating their launch through the ability to receive tax deductible donations.</p>
    <h3>Program Details</h3>
    <p>The first four months of the incubator program are intensive, where the newly forming organizations are led to develop their story, draft their business model, introduce a pilot, and pitch their vision to prospective partners.</p>
    <p>The following eight months (and more if desired) provides them with continued Wayfare membership and access to coaching, workshops, resources, tools, networks, and emotional support to build their organization into viability.</p>
