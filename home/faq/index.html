<li><h4>What happens at Wayfare Labs?</h4>

<p>Wayfare Labs runs a one-year startup incubator program for founders seeking to birth organizations that intentionally pursue the world&rsquo;s best future. Founders will launch and/or refine their world-changing ideas into viability through a program that includes coaching, workshops, networking, partner development, a pitch night, and more.</p></li>
<li><h4>How much time per week should I expect?</h4>

<p>Startups require full-time commitment. Through Wayfare’s unlimited membership package, you’ll have full access to work out of Wayfare&rsquo;s collaborative workspace to develop your organization. Participation in the program events&ndash;dinners, workshops, and presentations will make up a smaller but meaningful portion of your full time work week.</p></li>
<li><h4>What happens at the dinners?</h4>

<p>We will host guest founders around the dinner table each week to share off-the-record and engage in Q&amp;A about the good, bad, and ugly experiences they&rsquo;ve had through the launch of startups. You will also get time to process your experiences with fellow cohort members.</p></li>
<li><h4>What happens at the presentations nights?</h4>

<p>On presentation nights each month, cohort members will give formal presentations encompassing their learnings through the program. Each presentation will build upon the previous one as new topics are introduced in the workshops. At the close of the 4 month program, these presentations will be synthesized into a formal pitch to potential donors, investors, partners, family members, and friends.</p></li>
<li><h4>What happens at the workshops?</h4>

<p>Workshops are meant to serve as a launching pad for new areas of exploration for your startup. They will guide your thinking to further develop the story, business model, pilot, and ultimately the launch of your start up.</p></li>
<li><h4>Do we need to have a business plan before we begin the program?</h4>

<p>Nope! No matter where you are in the planning process for your organization, we will walk alongside of you to work toward your goals.</p></li>
<li><h4>Can we be a part of the program without moving to where you are?</h4>

<p>A critical part of our mission is that founders going through our program are immersed in a community and encouraging and supporting one another. With that said, it would be required that participants are able to work from our collaborative workspace located in Costa Mesa, CA.</p></li>
<li><h4>How much does it cost?</h4>

<p>Program fees are $8000 for the first component of the program, the launch phase,and $1,000/month after for continued Wayfare co-working membership, and free access to mentor network, discounted workshops fees, monthly coaching sessions, free access to alumni network and networking events. Collaborative donor development tools and campaigns will be provided to assist in raising these program fees and payment plans are available.</p></li>
<li><h4>How can we get funding for our startup?</h4>

<p>We will help you with resources and ideas about methods of fundraising, and then the rest is up to you! Fundraising and networking with potential donors is a skill needed for any organization to be successful, so we believe this will be a great opportunity to practice.</p></li>
